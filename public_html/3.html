						<p>A Living Will is a document that describes the kind of medical care you want or need to receive while you are still alive.  In most states you can have your wishes written into your will by your dentist or physician.  This means that  your wishes will be stated in your will o r your medical care directive.  You can also declare this in your bloodstream by prescription or electronically.  If you do not have the ability to verbally dictate your wishes you can have them electronicated.  While electronic prescriptions are preferable to hard copies, you can still have a hard copy of your document rather than just having paper copy.

Your will should describe how you would prefer your medical treatments and surgeries to be performed.  Do you want your doctor to use an open heart procedure or would you rather he use a robotic procedure?  Do you want your endometrial tissue to be removed, or do you want it to be removed gradually, over several weeks?  Do you want your abdomen large or small?  Do you want myriads of empty menstrual periods to be removed?  Do you have heavy bleeding or only a little?  Do you have frequent and painful periods or only a few periods per month?  Do you want artificial fertilization, tissue transplants, intrauterine devices, or amniocentesis?  Do you want to be hypnotized or dosed with medications?  Do you want psychotherapy or anti-anxiety medications?  Do you have aspirations to be a scare-monger or a soap boxerer?

You should also describe what you do and don't want.  Do you want your prescriptions to be written ahead of time so you don't have to wait?  Do you want to read your doctor's orders for any medications you are taking?  Do you want to have a list of your medications handy when the doctor is asking you about them?  Do you mind having injections, lasers, or invasive treatments?  Do you mind if your prescriptions aren't written up front?  Have you had a physical in the past year?  Have you ever had a nose job?  Are you interested in reconstructive plastic surgery?

Feesharpers orkickbacksare often included in medical bills.  Often, kickbacks are a down payment on a medical procedure, often purchased directly from the office based on a budget.  Some physicians advertised "fat, fat, fat" or "excessive fat" on their websites.  These terms are inflammatory and should be avoided.  Reps often send kickbacks as part of an effort to maintain their office's accounting control and overhead.  The physician who receives these kickbacks does not have to actually perform the "treatment" in question.

Be careful of the interest you express in your health.  Legitimate health care providers want to help you to lead a healthy and pleasant life.  However, just because they have your best interest in mind does not mean that they can never throw you under the knife.  Reps have the legal right to offer their services, but you have the right to refuse services that greatly outweigh your own comfort.
