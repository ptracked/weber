						<p>Croup, like a coughing spasm, is mainly a respiratory problem. It produces phlegm, a mucus-like substance, which fills the air passages of the lungs and nose. When this mucus becomes thick and becomes tight, the effect is that it prevents the drainage of air from the lungs. The phlegm tends to be regarded as a nuisance and is more likely to be experienced as a chronic condition. The constant coughing in this condition is also called chronic or persistent cough, because the duration of the coughing is generally longer than is generally recommended.

What Are The Causes of Croup Cough?

The exact causes of chronic or constant coughing are not yet known. Croup, like a regular cough, can be caused by a cold or by allergies, and it can also be caused by an overactive gland. In some cases of chronic or constant coughing, the symptoms may also be due to a lung infection, bronchitis or a chest infection.

It is not known why this constant coughing occurs. It is generally thought that once you start coughing incessantly, it can be because you have a bacterial infection in your upper respiratory system. It may also happen that you suffer from a condition in which the mucus is blocked in the airways, and the result is constant coughing. Mostly the causes of chronic or constant coughing are respiratory in nature, although it can also be associated with a stomach upset.

What Can Be Done About Croup Cough?

The best treatment for chocking-cough is to attach some white cottonLiquid drops of a local anesthetic, such as evident, or prepared ethers to the constricting mucus, determine the extent of the mucus, andidinexilicainehylidesceauseyl estimation. Another way to make the phlegm thin is by mixing borax and a cortisone-type steroid, such as methotryl or premyclor.

The most important thing to know is the cause of the cough, which will help you in knowing what to do once the cough goes away. If it is caused by a bacterial infection, it's important to keep antibiotics until the infection has been treated, just to make sure that it is gone. Garlic is a very good anti- bacterial agent. If you don't have garlic in your house, you can buy it in capsule or liquid form at any herbal store.

To somebody who suffers from constant or chronic cough it is difficult to know what is bothering him. When somebody tells you he coughs all the time, it may be simply because his throat is sore. But to somebody who suffers from intolerable and paroxysmal pain in the throat and nose, the cough is nothing but an ulcer. Whereas a simple sore throat may be enough to make your throat hurt.

A cough that lasts for more than two weeks is usually indicative of bronchitis. This can be treated with coughing drops or rest. Start in small way by using a cough syruple. Do not put denture unless your doctor tells you to. Among the causes of chronic cough are pneumonia, bronchiectasis, and bronchoceles. One can help himself to recover if he is concerned.
